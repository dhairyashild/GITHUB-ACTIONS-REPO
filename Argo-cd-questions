Alright, let's make this your ultimate Argo CD interview prep sheet â€“ concise, yet comprehensive!

Core GitOps & Argo CD:

Q: What is GitOps' primary principle? A: Git is the single source of truth.
Q: How does Argo CD ensure consistency? A: Continuously syncs Git to Kubernetes.
Q: What's the benefit of declarative deployments? A: Reproducibility and version control.
Q: What's the role of the Argo CD Application resource? A: Defines the desired application state.
Deployment & Management:

Q: How do you trigger an Argo CD deployment? A: By committing changes to Git.
Q: What are sync waves? A: Ordered application deployment.
Q: How do you handle secrets in Argo CD? A: Kubernetes Secrets, Sealed Secrets, or external tools.
Q: What is the purpose of self-heal in Argo CD? A: Automatically correct drift.
Q: What does Argo CD monitor? A: Application health and sync status.
Q: How do you perform a rollback in Argo CD? A: Revert to a previous Git commit.
Q: What is a target revision? A: the git commit, tag, or branch that Argo CD is syncing with.
Advanced & Troubleshooting:

Q: How do you manage multi-cluster deployments with Argo CD? A: Using ApplicationSets or multiple Application resources.
Q: How do you integrate Argo CD with CI/CD pipelines? A: Trigger Git commits from CI pipelines.
Q: How do you debug sync issues? A: Check Argo CD logs and Kubernetes events.
Q: What are common Argo CD scaling strategies? A: Resource optimization, sharding, and ApplicationSets.
Q: How do you manage Argo CD access control? A: RBAC and Argo CD roles.
Q: How do you implement blue/green deployments? A: Using separate Argo CD Applications and traffic management.
Q: How do you implement canary deployments? A: Using progressive syncs and traffic shifting.
Q: What are some Argo CD best practices? A: Secure access, monitor, automate, and use version control.
Q: What is the difference between automated and manual sync? A: Automated sync occurs without user intervention, manual requires user input.
Q: How do you handle configuration drift? A: ArgoCD will report and/or correct the drift based on the sync policy.
